                <p>Katheryn Elizabeth Hudson (born October 25, 1984), known professionally as Katy Perry, is an American singer, songwriter, and television personality. Born and raised in Santa Barbara, California, to Pentecostal pastor parents, Perry grew up listening to only gospel music and was often discouraged from listening to secular pop music. After earning a GED during her freshman year of high school, she pursued a career in music and initially ventured into gospel music, releasing her debut album, *Katy Hudson*, in 2001 under Red Hill Records, which was commercially unsuccessful. She later signed with Island Def Jam Records in 2004 and then Columbia Records before eventually signing a recording contract with Capitol Records in 2007. </p><p>Perry rose to fame in 2008 with her second album, *One of the Boys*, a pop rock record containing the singles "I Kissed a Girl" and "Hot n Cold." Her third album, *Teenage Dream* (2010), ventured into dance-pop and became the first album by a female artist to produce five number-one *Billboard* Hot 100 singles: "California Gurls," "Teenage Dream," "Firework," "E.T.," and "Last Friday Night (T.G.I.F.)." *PRISM* (2013), her fourth album, saw her incorporate elements of pop and dance and features the singles "Roar" and "Dark Horse," both reaching number one in the US. Her fifth album, *Witness* (2017), incorporated electro-pop elements. In 2019, she released the singles "Never Really Over" and "Harleys in Hawaii" ahead of her sixth studio album *Smile* (2020). Her seventh studio album, *KP6*, is set to be released in 2024.</p><p>Perry is known for her versatile musical style, which incorporates elements of pop, rock, disco, and electronic music. She is recognized for her vibrant and often outlandish costumes, stage performances, and humorous lyrical content. Her songs often revolve around themes of self-empowerment, love, and finding inner strength. She has received numerous awards and accolades throughout her career, including five American Music Awards, five Billboard Music Awards, five MTV Video Music Awards, and thirteen Grammy Award nominations. She has sold over 143 million records worldwide, making her one of the best-selling music artists of all time. Outside of music, Perry has ventured into acting and television, including voice roles in *The Smurfs* (2011) and *Smurfs 2* (2013) and serving as a judge on *American Idol* since 2018. She is also a businesswoman and philanthropist, launching her own fragrance line and supporting various charitable causes.</p>
